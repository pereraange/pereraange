- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pereraange
- I'm Angelo Perera a final year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate. I'm passionate about what I do and always try to walk the extra mile to learn and explore new things. I do not want to limit myself to one thing; instead, I want to hustle and educate myself with everything related to my subject. I am interested in biomedical instrumentation, Machine learning, and AI in medical engineering, Biomechanics, and Biomedical Signal Processing.
